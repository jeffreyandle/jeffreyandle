- Hi, I’m @jeffreyandle
- I’m semi retired but still working with some developers.
- I have worked in i4004, i8008, ... etc; MC6800, MC68000, PIC, TMS320, Arm, etc. as well as FORTRAN, C/C++/C#, MATLAB and assembly.
- I am no longer actively coding, but still contribute in support of hardware projects.
- I have not kept up with the myriad frameworks and prefer the challenge of wringing that last bit of speed/execution from a peripheral or MCU.
- 
- On the other hand I have debugged code that I never saw just knowing how the chip/peripheral worked and what the external issue was.
- 
- I am generally inept with github and used to use svn.  Bear with this old graybeard.
- 
- How to reach me ... No putting my email here but generally reachable on LinkedIn or Upwork, at least until I go full retired.
- 
- Recent HW projects:
- Nordic and SiLabs BLE/ZGP transmitters powered by finite energy kinetic harvesters (and the harvesters).
- Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors and passive wireless interrogators.
- Axzon/RFMicron RFID sensors and sensor systems and their interrogators.
- Renesas air power kit BLDC motor boards.
- Electric power instrumentation for partial discharge detection and asset monitoring.
